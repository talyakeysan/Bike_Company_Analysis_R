# Bike_Share_Company_Anlysis
### A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. 

For my capstone project in the Google Data Analytics course, I performed a comprehensive analysis of a bike-sharing company's data to better understand the differences between annual members and casual riders. I started by cleaning and adjusting the dataset in Excel, creating a pivot table to get an initial understanding of key metrics. I then imported the cleaned dataset into Google BigQuery for further analysis using SQL, where I ran complex queries to extract insights such as ride durations, frequency, and other key statistics. Additionally, I utilized R for advanced data cleaning and adjustments, followed by visualizing trends and patterns through various plots and charts. This analysis provided valuable insights into rider behavior, helping the company strategize for future business decisions.
